Different choices of transcriptome annotations can have a substantial impact on downstream genomic analyses, such as variant effect prediction and gene expression quantification. Yet, it remains unclear how these annotations can affect isoform-level quantification in RNA-seq. Here, we systematically compare isoform-level expression in 120 human fetal brain samples across multiple transcriptome annotations. We find negligible discrepancy between isoform expression when quantifying expression based on different versions of GENCODE (release 33 vs 38), while we observe substantial discrepancy when filtering for transcripts with well-supported annotation. Due to the lack of the ground truth for isoform expression, it is hard to discern the more accurate quantification, but we expect such quantification to yield a larger eQTL discovery in the future. Overall, our findings highlight the need for more comprehensive and high-confidence transcriptome annotation for accurate isoform-level quantification.
